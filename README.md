Other versions:
  - [Terminal version](https://github.com/farshadz1997/Microsoft-Rewards-bot)
  - [PyQt5 version](https://github.com/farshadz1997/Microsoft-Rewards-bot-GUI)

## Installations
With this app you can easily farm Microsoft Rewards on multiple accounts. All you need to do is run the following command to install the packages:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```


then run ```main.pyw```.

## Features
I added all features from two last version plus some new features:
  - Account management and display account log
  - Support proxy for each account (Proxy must not need to login)
  - Support Mobile user agent for each account (Don't add or change this if you don't know what this is)
  - You can choose to which part of Rewards you want to be done by Bot
  - Support headless browser
  - You can use session to create profile to save cookies of your account in that (By activating this it creates so many files and it takes n GBs of files if 
  many accounts which is totally normal)
  - Shutdown your system after farm if you enabled it
  - Fast mode for high speed connection which half delays
  - Auto start to run farmer on startup application
  - Timer to run the Bot at your choosen time
  - You can use Edge webdriver instead of Chrome
  - Send daily report to your Discord server and your Telegram
